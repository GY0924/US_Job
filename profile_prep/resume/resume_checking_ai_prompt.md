## 💡 We have to think in the recruiters' perspective

```
I am a recruiter reviewing a candidate's resume. Please carefully analyze the following to ensure the authenticity of the candidate and their qualifications:

* Grammar and Language: Review the resume for any grammatical or language issues that may suggest unprofessionalism or inaccuracy.

* Job Experience and Role Validation: Verify that the mentioned roles, responsibilities, and deployed apps or updates align with reasonable expectations for the timeframes listed at each company. Ensure the described functionalities are plausible and achievable within the stated periods.

* Technical Accuracy and Appropriateness: Check for any misuse or overstatement of technical terminology or activities that might be inconsistent with the described roles. Ensure that the technical skills and tasks mentioned are appropriate for the level and scope of each position.

* Career Trajectory: Assess whether the candidate's career progression makes logical sense and follows a reasonable path based on industry standards.
