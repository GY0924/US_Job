##  üì∞ Data Scientist Resume

Write professional, detailed, and results-focused resume bullet points for a Data Scientist role following these rules:

Research and analyze real products, core functionalities, and actual technical skill sets (including Python, R, SQL, ML/AI algorithms, cloud platforms, and analytics tools) that each company used during the specified period based on the given job role.

For each company, create 15+ impactful bullet points reflecting realistic contributions, measurable outcomes, and complexity suited to a Data Scientist.

Start each bullet with what functionality, feature, or model was developed, then explain how it was implemented, specifying exact programming languages, algorithms, frameworks, or tools.

Keep the tone experienced, direct, and technically precise, showing clear ownership and impact so hiring managers immediately understand what was built and how.

For recent roles, include bullet points tied to current industry trends such as Generative AI, LLMs, RAG pipelines, MLOps, cloud-based AI deployment, and real-time analytics.

Use bold formatting for important technologies, responsibilities, and achievements.

Ensure the bullet points demonstrate logical career progression, with increasing technical depth, leadership scope, and alignment with evolving data science industry standards. Avoid vague or AI-like phrasing.
