**4.** Make the language experienced, direct, and focused, so hiring managers can clearly see what was built and how.

**5.** If the role is current or recent, include bullet points tied to current industry trends in that space *(e.g., GenAI, RAG, AI integrations, Serverless, etc.).*

**6.** Use bold formatting to highlight important technologies, responsibilities, and achievements that showcase expertise.

**7.** The overall tone and content should reflect a true and reasonable logic for one’s career, showing clear technical growth, expanding responsibilities, and alignment with evolving industry standards.

**8.** *Show experienced in Node, Java and its related tech stacks, frameworks and libraries etc.*
